## Artifical Neural Network
An artificial neural network (ANN) is the component of artificial intelligence that is meant to simulate the functioning of a human brain. Processing units make up ANNs, which in turn consist of inputs and outputs. The inputs are what the ANN learns from to produce the desired output. ANN learning has been successfully applied for learning real-valued, discrete-valued, and vector-valued functions containing problems such as interpreting visual scenes, speech recognition, and learning robot control strategies.

## Churn Prediction
Churn prediction is the practice of analyzing data to detect customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions.

### Churn Modelling

It is very important in the customer retention analysis for any sector. The output of a predictive churn model is a measure of the immediate or future risk of a customer cancellation(in this case whether the customer will stay in the bank or leave the bank)

*1)* to understand why customers are leaving
*2)* to provide incentives to certain customers to prevent them from leaving
*3)* predicting the revenue of the business
